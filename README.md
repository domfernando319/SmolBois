# Issue: Tailwind CSS Styles Not Rendering

## Problem

I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS styles were not rendering correctly in my project, despite following various suggestions from online forums.

## Solution

The problem stemmed from spaces in the path specified in the `tailwindcss.config` file, which determines the files and directories where Tailwind CSS styles should be applied. Here is the corrected configuration:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}', // Issue: spaces between the file types
  ],
  // Other configurations...
};
